This is the git repository for the CS504 group Socrates. In this repository you will find code used to download and analyze the data set for our course project.

To generate the individual csv files containing 5 years worth of data, run the file getSandP.py (requires > 60mb of space). 

To combine the individual files into one (so it matches the kaggle data set), run the merge.sh script (requires an additional 60mb).
